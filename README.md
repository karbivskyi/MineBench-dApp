# MineBench

**MineBench** is a decentralized benchmarking platform that transforms hardware performance testing into a transparent, blockchain-connected experience.
It measures computing power, compares results, and rewards participants for contributing benchmark data.

Built for the **Colosseum Cypherpunks Hackathon**, MineBench explores how blockchain can bring fairness, verifiability, and incentives to the world of performance testing.

## Key Features

* Benchmark your hardware in real time
* Compare performance results globally
* On-chain data integrity and transparency
* Solana-based reward mechanics (coming soon)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/karbivskyi/MineBench-dApp.git
```

## Vision

MineBench aims to create an open, verifiable performance network â€” where every test result can be trusted, and every contributor is rewarded.
